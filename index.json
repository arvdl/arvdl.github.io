[{"categories":null,"contents":"   Intro  On the last update, Manjaro got so much packages updated, including the Gnome 40, Pacman 6.0, KDE 5.22.\nI\u0026rsquo;m using gnome with nvidia driver, so when the update hit me, i got an error. When I login to Gnome, there just blank window without anything. But the strange thing is my Night Ligt is activated, so I though there is no problem about the kernel driver nvidia.\nI checked the boot log from the tty session, there is no error related my nvidia driver. So I believe there is an error about my gnome desktop.\nBelow step-by-step I just done to solve my gnome40 blank issue.\n   Backup Previous Gnome Configuration  Turn up your computer and once you got the GDM login, press the button Ctrl + Alt + F2 to access the TTY session, then login with your username and password.\nBackup your gnome configuration using the following command.\n1  mv ~/.config/gnome/user ~/Desktop/user.bak      Add New User  Create new user to generate default gnome configuration and reboot the system.\n1 2 3 4  sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash newuser sudo passwd newuser sudo reboot   Now you must login to the gnome desktop with the new user, and the default gnome configuration ~/.config/gnome/user will be generated.\n   Copy Configuration from New User to Old User  Once you get the GDM login, access the TTY session again and login with your OLD user and password.\nGrab the root privileges and copy the gnome configuration from the New User home directory to the Old User home directory.\n1 2 3 4  sudo su cp /home/newuser/.config/gnome/user /home/olduser/.config/gnome/user sudo chown olduser:olduser /home/olduser/.config/gnome/user   Now reboot your system sudo reboot.\n   Login with the Old User and Cleanup  Now you can login again to the gnome desktop with old user and everything under your home directory is safe, you just need to setup the gnome desktop again as your flavour.\nNow you can delete the new user that we\u0026rsquo;ve created before.\n1  sudo userdel -r newuser   And everything is back.\nThe gnome40 is amazing with smooth transition etc, its just awesome ðŸ™ˆ.\n","date":"Jul 14","permalink":"https://arvdl.github.io/posts/gnome40-manjaro-blank/","tags":["desktop"],"title":"Gnome40 Manjaro Blank After Upgrade"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"Jul 12","permalink":"https://arvdl.github.io/articles/","tags":null,"title":"Articles"},{"categories":null,"contents":"   Intro  MAC address (Media Access Control) is an identifier for our network devices that we use. It\u0026rsquo;s unique identifier, every network devices has different identities.\nMostly, MAC address are available at IEEE 802 networking technology such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. And every devies that we uses such as Laptop, Computer, or even Smartphone has MAC address on top of it.\nFor this guide, i will show you how to automatically change MAC address of your Linux system using systemd-networkd service and using the NetworkManager application.\n   Check MAC address  Before going any further, check the MAC address on the system using the ip command as below.\n1  ip a   And you will be shown the MAC address of your machine as link/ether 12:9a:5b:0d:xx:xx ....\nIf you want to know what a vender of your MAC address you used, visit the site https://macvendors.com/, copy and paste your MAC address on the page, and you will get details vender of your MAC address you\u0026rsquo;re using.\n   Spoof MAC address with systemd-networkd service  The systemd-networkd is a services that manages networking configuration. As networking devices appears, the service will automatically detects and configure your networking devies. Also, it can create virtual network devices.\nThe systemd-networkd is part of systemd, so ensure you\u0026rsquo;re using an operating system with systemd running on top of your OS.\nRun the systemd-networkd services and add it to start automaticall on the system boot using following commands.\n1 2  sudo systemctl start systemd-networkd sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd   Next, create a new configuration for your devices on the /etc/systemd/network directory. For example below I create the configuration wlan0.link to change my wlan0 interface MAC address.\n1  sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/wlan0.link   Change MACAddress=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx with your real MAC address, copy and paste to your configuration.\n[Match] MACAddress=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx [Link] MACAddressPolicy=random NamePolicy=kernel database onboard slot path Save.\nNOTE:\nInstead of random MAC address on every boot, you can use pre-defined static MAC address by changing the MACAddressPolicy=random to static configuration MACAddress=Static Spoofed MAC.\nNow restart the systemd-networkd services to apply.\n1  sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd   Check again your MAC address usin gthe ip a command and it has been changed. Otherwise, you can reboot your system.\n   Spoof MAC Address with NetworkManager  The second way to change MAC address is by using the NetworkManager application, mostly available on every Linux Desktop.\nEdit the /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf configuration file.\n1  sudo vim /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf   Now paste the following configuration to the end of the line.\n[device-mac-randomization] # \u0026quot;yes\u0026quot; is already the default for scanning wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=yes [connection-mac-randomization] # Randomize MAC for every ethernet connection ethernet.cloned-mac-address=random # Generate a random MAC for each WiFi and associate the two permanently. wifi.cloned-mac-address=random Save and close.\nNext, restart the NetworkManager services to apply.\n1  sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager   As a result, you will get random MAC address everytime you make connection to the network, on Wi-Fi and Ethernet.\n   Reference  Archwiki\nGnome NetworkManager\n","date":"Jul 12","permalink":"https://arvdl.github.io/posts/mac-address-linux/","tags":["privacy","tips"],"title":"MAC Address Spoofing on Linux"}]
